# dagenstest

## Test Tabling
## This is my solution to the job-test. It can all be done on the same page, no need for routing or different html files.
## For the final array sorting problem I chose to use 3 for loops, although discovered many ways to do this.
## No FS was used in this database and it is NOT required.
